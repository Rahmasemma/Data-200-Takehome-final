### **Task**: Scrape data from Goodreads.com üìö

---

### **Objective**
For this exam, you will scrape and analyze data from Goodreads.com. The work is split into two parts, each focusing on different aspects of the data
1. **"Best Books" Analysis**: Explore Goodreads' "Best Books" lists for a specific year.
2. **Author-Level Analysis**: Study the trends and patterns in the works of a specific author.

---

### **Instructions**

#### **Task 1: Best Books**
You are tasked with analyzing Goodreads' "Best Books" lists for a specific year based on the **first letter of your first name**. For example, if your first name starts with **A‚ÄìE**, you are assigned to the year **2023**; if it starts with **F‚ÄìJ**, you are assigned to **2022**, and so on:

| Initials | Assigned Year | URL                                              |
|----------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| A‚ÄìE      | 2023          | [Best Books of 2023](https://www.goodreads.com/list/best_of_year/2023) |
| F‚ÄìJ      | 2022          | [Best Books of 2022](https://www.goodreads.com/list/best_of_year/2022) |
| K‚ÄìO      | 2021          | [Best Books of 2021](https://www.goodreads.com/list/best_of_year/2021) |
| P‚ÄìT      | 2020          | [Best Books of 2020](https://www.goodreads.com/list/best_of_year/2020) |
| U‚ÄìZ      | 2019          | [Best Books of 2019](https://www.goodreads.com/list/best_of_year/2019) |



**Your Tasks**:
1. Scrape data from the Goodreads "Best Books of [Year]" list:
   - **URL**: https://www.goodreads.com/list/best_of_year/2023 (replace the year with your assigned year). You can also use the table above.
2. Collect the following data for each book:
   - Title
   - Publication date (first published)
   - Author
   - Genre (if available, and feel free to pick the first genre listed)
   - Average rating
   - Number of ratings
   - Number of pages
   - Rank
   - Language (if available)
   - Number of people who are currently reading (if available)
   - Number of people who want to read (if available)
3. Perform the following analyses:
   - **Genre ratings**:
       - Compare average ratings across genres. Which 2-3 genres tends to have the highest ratings? Create a table showing average rating score, and average rank by genre.
   - **Popularity and ratings**:
       - Examine whether books with more ratings tend to have higher or lower average scores. Create a scatterplot showing the relationship between the number of ratings and average rating. On the x-axis, you should have **number of ratings**; on the y-axis, you should have **average rating**.

---

#### **Task 2: Author-Level Analysis**
You are now tasked with analyzing books by a specific author based on the **first letter of your first name**:

| Your first name initial | Author              | Author Goodreads link                               | Birthday       |
|----------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| A‚ÄìE      | Stephen King        | [Stephen King](https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/3389)         | Sep 21, 1947   |
| F‚ÄìJ      | George R.R. Martin  | [George R.R. Martin](https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/346732) | Sep 20, 1948   |
| K‚ÄìO      | Ernest Hemingway    | [Ernest Hemingway](https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/1455)     | Jul 21, 1899   |
| P‚ÄìT      | Neil Gaiman         | [Neil Gaiman](https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/1221698)       | Nov 10, 1960   |
| U‚ÄìZ      | Nora Roberts        | [Nora Roberts](https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/625)          | Oct 10, 1950   |


**Your Tasks**:
1. Scrape all books by your assigned author:
   - Use the link provided for your author.
2. Collect the following data for each book:
   - Title
   - Publication date (first published)
   - Author
   - Genre (if available, and feel free to pick the first genre listed)
   - Average rating
   - Number of ratings
   - Number of pages
   - Rank (from the books written by the author)
   - Language (if available)
   - Number of people who are currently reading (if available)
   - Number of people who want to read (if available)
3. Perform the following analyses:
   - **Language Distribution**:
     - How many books has the author published in English? In other languages? Create a table showing the count of books by language.
   - **Author's Age and Page Count**:
     - Do authors tend to write longer books as they age? Use the author's birthday to calculate their age at the time of each book's publication. Create a line plot with **author's age** on the x-axis and **page count** on the y-axis.
   - **Author's Age and Rating**:
     - For English-only books, create a line plot with **author's age** on the x-axis and **average rating** on the y-axis.
     - Repeat the analysis including books in languages other than English. Does your interpretation change?
   - **Pages vs. Ratings**:
     - Is there a relationship between the number of pages and a book's average rating? Create a scatterplot with **page count** on the x-axis and **average rating** on the y-axis.
   - **Interest on a book**:
     - Is there a relationship between the number of people who are currently reading the book and the number of people who left a rating? Create a scatterplot with **number of people who are currently reading** on the x-axis and **number of ratings** on the y-axis. Create a second scatterplot with **average rating** on the y-axis. Do books with more interest tend to receive higher ratings?

---

### **Submission Requirements**
Submit your work as a single `.ipynb` file, along with a copy of it as a `.md` file. The notebook should include:
1. **Code**:
   - Well-documented python code using Selenium for web scraping.
   - Proper error handling and strategies for dynamic content.
2. **Cleaned Data**:
   - Include the cleaned datasets from both tasks as .csv files. You can upload them in your github repo.
3. **Analysis and Report**:
   - Present your findings using markdown cells, tables, and visualizations you make in python.
   - Address all questions posed for your assigned tasks.
4. **Visualizations**:
   - Include relevant charts (e.g., bar charts, line plots, scatterplots) to support your conclusions.

### **Rubric**

| Item                        | Weight |
|-----------------------------|--------|
| Code accuracy               | 25%    |
| Code clarity and annotation | 25%    |
| Exploratory data analysis   | 25%    |
| Discussion of findings      | 25%    |

---

### **Tips**
- Make sure to insert time.sleep() right after you request driver to go to a link (before requesting elements). Make sure to wait at least 0.7 second, or even slightly higher if you run into issues.
- Try-except blocks will be your friend because xpath positions on a page may differ depending on the book and content availability.

# ## Web Scraping Goodreads Data

This script automates the process of extracting detailed book data from Goodreads using Selenium. The data includes fields such as title, author, average rating, publication date, genres, language, and reader statistics. 

Key measures taken in the script include:
- **Dynamic Content Handling**: The script uses `WebDriverWait` to ensure all elements are fully loaded before extraction.
- **Error Handling**: `try-except` blocks handle missing elements, timeouts, and other potential issues gracefully, assigning default values like `"Not Found"` for unavailable fields.
- **Data Structuring**: Extracted data is stored in a dictionary format and appended to a list for easy conversion to a CSV file.
- **Scalability**: The script processes multiple book URLs from an input CSV file and saves the enriched data to an output CSV file.

The final dataset includes fields such as:
- Title
- Author
- Average Rating
- Publication Date
- First Genre
- Language
- Number of Ratings
- Pages
- Reader Statistics (e.g., "Currently Reading" and "Want to Read").

The use of Selenium allows for robust automation and scraping of dynamic webpages, making the script suitable for extracting detailed data from Goodreads.

# ## Goodreads Author Book Data Scraping with Selenium

This Python script automates the process of scraping detailed book data from an author's Goodreads page. It utilizes Selenium to navigate through multiple pages of the author's book list and extracts specific details for each book, such as title, publication date, genre, ratings, and more. 

### Purpose
The goal is to build a comprehensive dataset of the author's books for further analysis, including enriched metadata for each book.

---

## Key Features of the Script

### 1. **Dynamic Web Scraping**
- The script loops through all pages of the author's book list using a base URL format (e.g., `https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/...`).
- It dynamically identifies and processes book entries on each page.

### 2. **Field Extraction**
For each book, the following details are extracted:
- **Title**: The name of the book.
- **URL**: The link to the book's Goodreads page.
- **Publication Date**: The release date of the book.
- **Genre**: The primary genre of the book.
- **Average Rating**: The book's average reader rating.
- **Number of Ratings**: The total number of ratings the book received.
- **Number of Pages**: The total number of pages in the book.

### 3. **Dynamic Navigation**
- The script navigates to each book's individual page to gather additional information (e.g., publication date, genre, and ratings).
- After extracting data from a book page, it navigates back to the author's main book list page to continue scraping.

### 4. **Error Handling**
- The script uses `try-except` blocks to gracefully handle missing elements or timeouts for dynamic content loading.
- Default values like `"Not Found"` are assigned if a field cannot be retrieved.

### 5. **Output**
The extracted data is stored in a Pandas DataFrame and saved as a CSV file (`neil_gaiman_books.csv`) for analysis.

---

## Workflow Breakdown

1. **Initialization**
   - The Selenium WebDriver is initialized, and the base URL for the author's book list is defined.
   - A loop iterates through all pages of the book list (e.g., 71 pages in this case).

2. **Book Data Extraction**
   - On each page:
     - All book rows are identified using XPath.
     - For each book:
       - Fields like title, publication date, and genre are extracted.
       - Selenium navigates to the book's individual page to gather detailed information.
       - The extracted data is appended to a list in dictionary format.

3. **Error Management**
   - Handles dynamic content and missing elements using:
     - `WebDriverWait` for waiting on elements.
     - Default values like `"Not Found"` for missing data.

4. **Saving Data**
   - After all pages and books are processed, the collected data is saved to a CSV file for future use.

5. **Cleanup**
   - The WebDriver is closed to free resources after data collection is complete.

---

## Key Considerations
- **Scalability**: The script dynamically handles any number of pages or books.
- **Robustness**: Error handling ensures uninterrupted operation, even with occasional failures in data retrieval.
- **Comprehensive Dataset**: Fields like genre, ratings, and page count provide valuable metadata for analysis.

---

## Output
The final output is saved as `neil_gaiman_books.csv`, containing:
- Book titles
- URLs
- Publication dates
- Genres
- Ratings and more.

This dataset can be used for detailed analysis or visualization of the author's works.

# ## Goodreads Author Language and Reader Statistics Scraping with Selenium

This Python script uses Selenium to scrape information about books from an author's Goodreads page, focusing specifically on the language of the book and reader statistics. It dynamically navigates through multiple pages of the author's book list to collect detailed data.

---

## Purpose
The purpose of this script is to collect metadata about books written by a specific author. This includes:
- The language in which the book is available.
- The number of people currently reading the book.
- The number of people who want to read the book.

---

## Key Features of the Script

### 1. **Dynamic Web Scraping**
- The script loops through 23 pages of the author's book list using a base URL format (e.g., `https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/...`).
- Each page is processed iteratively to extract information about individual books.

### 2. **Field Extraction**
The following fields are collected for each book:
- **Language**: Extracted from the "Book details and editions" section.
- **Currently Reading**: The number of readers currently engaged with the book.
- **Want to Read**: The number of people who have marked the book as a "Want to Read."

### 3. **Dynamic Navigation**
- The script navigates to the individual book pages for each book.
- It returns to the main author page after collecting the required details for a book.

### 4. **Error Handling**
- Robust error handling using `try-except` blocks to manage:
  - **Timeouts**: Dynamic elements that take too long to load.
  - **Missing Elements**: Fields that are unavailable for certain books.
  - **Stale Elements**: Ensures smooth operation by retrying if the page structure updates unexpectedly.

### 5. **Output**
The extracted data is saved in a Pandas DataFrame and exported to a CSV file (`goodreads_enriched_data.csv`) for further analysis.

---

## Workflow Breakdown

1. **Initialization**
   - The Selenium WebDriver is initialized, and the base URL for the author's book list is defined.
   - A loop iterates through all pages to dynamically extract book rows.

2. **Data Extraction**
   - On each page:
     - XPath locates each book row and retrieves the book URL.
     - For each book:
       - The script navigates to the book's individual page to extract:
         - Language
         - Number of people currently reading
         - Number of people who want to read
       - The extracted data is appended to a list in dictionary format.

3. **Error Handling**
   - Ensures smooth scraping even when:
     - Certain elements are unavailable.
     - Pages or elements take too long to load.
     - The webpage structure changes dynamically.

4. **Saving Data**
   - After processing all pages, the extracted data is saved as a CSV file.

5. **Cleanup**
   - The WebDriver is closed after data collection is complete to free system resources.

# ## Data Cleaning and Analysis of Goodreads Book Data

This Python script performs data cleaning and analysis on a dataset of books from Goodreads. The data includes fields such as title, author, ratings, publication dates, genres, and more. The script prepares the data for analysis by cleaning invalid or inconsistent entries and performs visualizations to extract insights.

---

## Purpose
The goal of this script is to clean, transform, and analyze the Goodreads book data to answer specific research questions such as:
- How does an author's age correlate with the page count of their books?
- How does an author's age relate to the average rating of their books?
- Is there a relationship between the number of pages and the average rating of a book?
- Do books with more readers have more ratings or higher average ratings?

---

## Key Features of the Script

### 1. **Data Cleaning**
- **`Number of Pages`:** Extracted numeric values from text entries using regular expressions (e.g., removed units like "pages").
- **`Number of Ratings`:** Removed non-numeric characters (e.g., commas).
- **`Want to Read`:** Handled shorthand (e.g., "k") by converting it to numeric values.
- **`Average Rating`:** Converted to numeric values, handling invalid entries as `NaN`.
- **`Publication Date`:** Extracted the year and calculated the author's age at the time of publication.

### 2. **Data Transformation**
- Rows with missing or invalid values in critical columns (e.g., `Number of Pages`, `Author_Age`, `Average Rating`) were removed.
- Columns were converted to appropriate numeric data types for analysis.

### 3. **Visualizations**
The script generates the following visualizations to answer the analysis questions:
1. **Author's Age vs. Page Count:** A line plot to analyze whether authors write longer books as they age.
2. **Author's Age vs. Average Rating:**
   - For English-only books: A line plot to explore trends in ratings for English-language books.
   - For all books: A line plot to compare trends across all languages.
3. **Pages vs. Average Rating:** A scatterplot to analyze the relationship between page count and ratings.
4. **Reader Interest Analysis:** Scatterplots to explore:
   - The relationship between the number of people currently reading a book and the number of ratings.
   - Whether books with higher interest (currently reading counts) tend to have higher ratings.

---

## Workflow Breakdown

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Cleaned and standardized columns like `Number of Pages`, `Number of Ratings`, and `Want to Read`.
   - Extracted and calculated the author's age at the time of publication using the publication date and birth year.

2. **Analysis**
   - Conducted analyses on the cleaned data to answer the research questions.

3. **Visualizations**
   - Created informative plots to visualize trends and relationships in the data.

---

## Example Data Cleaning
### Before Cleaning:
- `Number of Pages`: `"635 pages, Kindle Edition"`
- `Number of Ratings`: `"12,345 ratings"`
- `Want to Read`: `"1.2k"`

### After Cleaning:
- `Number of Pages`: `635`
- `Number of Ratings`: `12345`
- `Want to Read`: `1200`

---

## Output Visualizations
### 1. Author's Age vs. Page Count
A line plot showing whether authors write longer books as they age.

### 2. Author's Age vs. Average Rating
Line plots comparing ratings trends for English-only books and all books.

### 3. Pages vs. Average Rating
A scatterplot to evaluate whether longer books tend to receive higher ratings.

### 4. Reader Interest Analysis
Scatterplots analyzing the relationship between:
- The number of people currently reading a book and the number of ratings it received.
- The number of people currently reading a book and its average rating.

---

## Output
The cleaned data is saved in-memory and used for analysis. Visualizations are displayed for insights and interpretation.

---

## Key Considerations
- **Flexibility:** Handles diverse data formats and missing values.
- **Reproducibility:** Outputs and visualizations are reproducible given the input dataset.
- **Insights:** Provides actionable insights into trends and relationships in the Goodreads dataset.

This script can be extended for further analysis or adapted to other datasets with similar structure.
